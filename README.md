## The journey

In May 2023, I arrived at the most important part of my computer science course (CS50), the final project. From here I took a long break to think seriously about what I wanted to build, because I wanted it to be a project that reflected my being. In the sense that the project had to show the skills I had acquired during the course, but also look to the future. Furthermore, I wanted my project to show that I had the ability to learn skills outside the course. At the time I was in the penultimate year of high school and I liked playing games, but a lot, so I decided to create a game. During the course I loved how intuitive and simple the Python programming language was, so I used Python as my programming language. Unfortunately Python itself doesn't have a framework to work with so I went online and discovered the Pygame library, which is specifically made for creating video games. From here I spent 1 week learning the basics of this library to discover its full potential. I leave below the link to the video I watched to learn this library.

## THE TYPE OF GAME

Now that my toolbox was complete I had to decide what kind of game to create, the mechanics, the design and everything else. Since I was never good at art, I decided not to abuse sprites, because they required a lot of memory and especially time to create. So my game mainly uses Pygame's draw function, because it allows you to draw shapes and images on the screen at will, hence the name 'Draw Empire'.

## THE CODE

First, I created the general setting of the game, i.e. I made an active and inactive game system and also an information page. At this point the skeleton was ready but was not yet able to move. Next I moved on to create the map which is simply a matrix of booleans, where true stands for a wall and false for free space. Now that the map was complete it was time to code the player's basic movements, including aiming with the mouse, at this stage I had to brush up on my trigonometry basics. (It is said that to be a good programmer one must have a solid foundation in mathematics). Now that the protagonist was ready I had to create the npc's, with their movements and attacks. Finally I embellished the game a bit by adding end-screens, sound effects and new mechanics such as changing weapons.

## DIFFICULTIES

During my journey I encountered many problems that held me back for a while. One of them was just how to structure my project in a systematic and orderly manner. To solve this, I went to watch the Object Oriented Programming lesson of CS50P to get a good understanding of how object-oriented programming works. Another tough obstacle I encountered along the way was that npc's often got stuck against walls, to solve this I found path-finding algorithms online and brought them into my project, I leave the link to the page here.

## NEW SKILLS

Thanks to this project I learnt many new skills that were not in the course. These included video editing, photoshop, logical thinking, problem solving, working with frameworks and googling errors.

## GREETINGS

After all, I loved this course, not just because of the things I learnt but because of how it made me fall in love with the world of computers and I think it really lit my way. Now I hope that this is not the end, but just the beginning of a journey that I hope will last forever. THIS IS CS50! Goodbye world.
